# stremio-addon-animepahe

 WIP addon to fetch the catalog and streams from AnimePahe.

## Adding to Stremio

On [Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com), go to "Addons", click "Add Addon" and paste this link:

```

```

This is hosted on the free tier of Clouddlare Workers, so may be ratelimited; please selfhost this if you have problems.

## Usage

When you'll search something in Stremio at the bottom of the results you will see a new "Animepahe" catalog, and you can access content from there.

On some platforms you may need to select "Specials" for the episodes to be visible.

Note that results may take a few seconds longer to appear compared to the native Stremio catalog, particularly for series with a lot of episodes.
